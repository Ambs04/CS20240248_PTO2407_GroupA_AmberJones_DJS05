## Report on challenge:

- My code runs in form of a UI and slo by basic dispatching of actions and console logging store.getState().
- I decided to not only focus on the background implementation of redux in my challenge, but also focus on implementing the redux to UI. I wanted to do this in order to solidify my understanding of redux, whilst also witnessing the pure functions of functional programing at its core.
- I faced challanges with regards to syntax, but other than that, i feel that i have a whole new understanding of state management and the benefits of functional programming by use of pure functions that are not dependable on other functions.

## How to run my code:

Simply run a live session and interact with the UI elements or open dev tools and dipatch actions into the console and log store.getState(). Alternatively look to my script.js where i have already added some dispatch actions to the console.
